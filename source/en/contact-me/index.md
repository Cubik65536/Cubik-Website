ðŸ“« Contact Me

If you want to contact me, the most efficient way is to send emails to me. I will check my inbox every 4 to 5 hours, so you should get my response pretty quickly unless the mail system moves your message to the junk box, which I usually will clear directly after a quick check every week (so it's possible that I can't even see your email before it got deleted).

> **If you have not got my reply for a long time, check your junk box!**

</p>

*I will **ALWAYS** use my PGP signature when I reply or send messages with my email, and I will **ALWAYS** encrypt my message when I reply to an **encrypted** message.*

**If you received a reply message but was not signed with `.`, it is very likely that the message was not sent by me unless I publicly revoked `.` and changed my keys. Please refer to [My PGP](/en/my-pgp/) page for more information.**
